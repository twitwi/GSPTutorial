Welcome to the GSP tutorial
===========================

GSP stands for “Generic Service Processor” but it is not that important.
The GSP framework is a very lightweight component system that handles both Java and C(++) modules.
It has been designed to make both using and writing modules as easy as possible.


Downloading the GSP and some modules
====================================

For this tutorial, you will need some libraries including the framework and some module libraries.
Just open the lib/GETALL.txt and download each http://... file into the lib folder.
If you know/have “wget”, you can directly run the script with “sh ./GETALL.txt”.


Additional installation on your computer
========================================

With the libraries above, you have actually more than the minimum that is required.
However, you might want to do additional things like handling videos.
Here is what you might need.
* GStreamer
  * Linux
      If you are using ubuntu, please install "libgstreamer0.10-dev" package.
      Alternatively, if you have gstreamer installed but you don't have the
      "-dev" package, you can run
      <pre>ln -s /usr/lib/libgstreamer-0.10.so.0 libgstreamer-0.10.so</pre>

  * MacOS: (untested) try http://itee.uq.edu.au/~davel/gstreamer/
  * Windows: (untested) try http://code.google.com/p/ossbuild/

* For the pipeline viewer
  * Linux: something like “aptitude install libsaxonb-java graphviz”
  * Other: to be done...
