GSP Tutorial
============

This project is a tutorial to the [GSP framework](https://github.com/twitwi/GSP).

Ideally you can follow, one by one, the tutorial files:
* tutorial-1: getting everything: do I need to install anything?
* tutorial-2: running a simple test pipeline
* tutorial-3: passing parameters

<b>NB:</b> Once you've passed “tutorial-1”, you should be able to operate offline.
