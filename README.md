GSP Tutorial
============

This project is a tutorial to the [GSP framework](https://github.com/twitwi/GSP).

Just clone me:
> git clone git://github.com/twitwi/GSPTutorial.git

Then, ideally you can follow the tutorial files:

* tutorial-1: getting everything: do I need to install anything?
* tutorial-2: running a simple test pipeline and hacking parameters
* tutorial-3: same as tutorial-2 but with video
* tutorial-4: understanding the syntax for connectors
* tutorial-5: making a simple video module

<b>NB:</b> Once you've passed “tutorial-1”, you should be able to operate offline.
