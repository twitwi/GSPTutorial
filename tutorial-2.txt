Running an existing pipeline
============================

A GSP pipeline defines an assembly of modules that are plugged together.

Just running it
---------------

First we will just run a trivial pipeline that just counts from 10 to 15 (excluded).
You can run it like this:

   java -cp 'lib/*' fr.prima.gsp.Launcher pipelines/pipeline-1-simple.xml

Alternatively, you can use the provide helper script:

   ./run.sh   pipelines/pipeline-1-simple.xml

The output might contain logging information.
It should also contain the expected output:
  J INFO: 10
  J INFO: 11
  J INFO: 12
  J INFO: 13
  J INFO: 14


Understanding it
----------------

Please open the pipeline file (pipelines/pipeline-1-simple.xml) to understand what it does.
Overall, the comments within the xml file should be sufficient to understand.

The "m" tags stand for "module" (you can actually use module if you prefer), the "c" stands for "connector".
Note that the order in the file is not important


Visualizing it
--------------

If you want (and have the necessary stuff), you can visualize your pipeline file.
In this tutorial the visualization are provided for some of the provided pipelines.
For example, the first pipeline has its associated rendered view in:

   pipelines/pipeline-1-simple.xml.svg

SVG files can be viewed with image viewers or browsers.
