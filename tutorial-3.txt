Running an existing pipeline: example with videos
=================================================

This tutorial just applies the previous one on a pipeline with images/videos.
If you want to do this tutorial, you need "gstreamer", see the tutorial-1 for details on its installation. 


Playing with the pipeline
-------------------------

   ./run.sh   pipelines/pipeline-2-view-video.xml

You should see an uninteresting video.
Please note that if you see and the moving box is red, then something need to be done but for now you can continue like this.

Here again you can play with the parameters.
The most interesting is probably the "period":

   ./run.sh pipelines/pipeline-2-view-video.xml   for.period=1
   ./run.sh pipelines/pipeline-2-view-video.xml   for.period=1 cons.level=0
   ./run.sh pipelines/pipeline-2-view-video.xml   for.period=333 view.exitOnClose=true view.enabled=false
   ./run.sh pipelines/pipeline-2-view-video.xml   for.period=1 view.enabled=false
